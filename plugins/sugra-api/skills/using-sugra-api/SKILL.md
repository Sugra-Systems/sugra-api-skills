# Using the Sugra API

Sugra API is intelligence infrastructure: one HTTP API, one key, seven product directions. Domain-agnostic. Do not frame it through one vertical.

The surface is LLM-friendly: one `x-api-key`, one JSON envelope `{data, meta}` on every direction, MCP as the agent-native entry. Documentation truth is https://docs.sugra.ai (search and Ask AI). This skill is a map, not the catalog.

These files are English. Reply in the user's language.

Public hedge (not a live count): 1,500+ endpoints, 160+ primary sources, 36 domains. Live counts: skill `live-docs`.

## Two complete ways in

| Surface | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| HTTPS `https://sugra.ai` | The agent can GET/POST | `x-api-key` on `/api/v1/...` |
| MCP | The host is an MCP client | hosted `https://mcp.sugra.ai/mcp` or local `sugra-api-mcp` |

Both reach the same API. Use the surface the host already has, or the one the user named. Key: https://app.sugra.ai/settings/billing (Free: 50 requests/day). Do not log the key.

## Seven directions (one key, one budget)

| Direction | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Sugra Finance | Equities, fundamentals, filings, fixed income, derivatives, crypto, forex |
| Sugra Macro | Central banks, national statistics, FRED, IMF, World Bank, OECD |
| Sugra Entity | Company resolution, sanctions and watchlist screening, identifiers |
| Sugra Net Atlas | Internet infrastructure: ASNs, prefixes, IXPs, routing, DNS |
| Sugra News | Global news flow and event signals |
| Sugra Earth | Weather, hazards, energy, transport, air quality, climate |
| Sugra Research | Scientific, patent, and academic datasets |
