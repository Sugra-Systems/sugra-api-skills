# Cross-domain briefing

Split the question. Call two or three operations. Do not invent a combined index. HTTP and MCP are both valid; use the surface already connected (skill `connect`).

## Pattern

1. Split the question into 2-3 concrete asks (place, series, snapshot).
2. For each ask, discover then call (`discover-and-call`). Prefer sovereign or intergovernmental sources when the catalog offers them.
3. Keep units, geography, and clocks separate. Do not blend a port throughput z-score with a weather reading into one invented number.
4. Quote each figure with its source from `meta` and its `as_of` / `meta.data_time`.
5. Close with what the catalog did not cover, not a prediction.

## Example shape (not a canned path list)

"What is happening around a chokepoint this week?" can be three calls: port throughput deviation for the waterway's ports, current conditions at a coordinate on the route, and one related sovereign or intergovernmental series the live OpenAPI or MCP catalog actually lists. Discover, call, present side by side.

The MCP prompt `earth_conditions` is a one-coordinate weather recipe. This skill is the longer form when weather is only one pane.

## Do not

- Do not add per-endpoint MCP tools to make the briefing shorter.
- Do not treat screening as a briefing source unless the question is about a named party.
- Do not call hosted-only MCP tools on stdio.
- Do not frame the output as investment, legal, or routing advice.
